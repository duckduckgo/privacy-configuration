# Auto Respond to PR Workflow
#
# This workflow automatically generates and posts diff comments showing changes to generated configuration files.
#
# ## Generated Diff Output Guide:
# - **X files changed**: Multiple files with identical changes (collapsed for readability)
# - **X files identical**: Files that are exactly the same between base and PR branches
# - **File headers**: Show `--- filename (and X other files)` when multiple files share the same diff
# - **File lists**: Individual files are listed under each collapsed section
# - **Sections**: `latest` (current config version, expanded) and `legacy` (older versions, collapsed)
#
# The diff script groups files by their actual changes to reduce noise and improve review efficiency.

                      üëã Don't forget to **add an individual reviewer** (in addition to those auto-added), as this will create a task for them in Asana.
                      - The best reviewer is most likely a feature or platform owner.
                       - If they've got permission to approve, you're good to merge. See [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/blob/main/CODEOWNERS)
                       - As a fallback the Global owners are:
                         - [Breakage AOR](https://github.com/orgs/duckduckgo/teams/breakage-aor)
                         - [Breakage triagers](https://github.com/orgs/duckduckgo/teams/breakage)
                         - [Config AOR](https://github.com/orgs/duckduckgo/teams/config-aor)

                      üëâ Please mark this as DRAFT unless there's an intention to merge this immediately.
                      üëâ Click "Merge when ready" if you're happy for this to be automatically merged once reviewed. (If not available, ensure you've signed in to DuckDuckGo oauth.)
                      üëâ Don't forget to add schema changes to validate if you're adding/changing a feature.
