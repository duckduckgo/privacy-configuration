alwaysApply: false
description: Apply this rule when user asks about adding an autofill "site specific rule", "setting" or a "remote fix" for a specific domain. These rules are used by the autofill package to fix issues that cannot be fixed via heuristics. The rules exist inside the override files, within the autofill feature as "siteSpecificFixes" 
---
- types of settings we have (schema) can be read from schema/features/autofill.ts
- Some rules are only applicable for certain platforms, those should be added only to the respective override files
- Clarify which platform the user is interested in, if not explicitly stated
- Use jsonpatch syntax for the patchSettings
- Run `npm test` when all files are updated (nvm use, if needed)
