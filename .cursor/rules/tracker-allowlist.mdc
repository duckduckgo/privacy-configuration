# Tracker Allowlist Mitigation Instructions

## Background

Tracker Allowlist is used to allow specific tracker requests that would normally be blocked by the tracker radar, where necessary to fix website breakages. The feature configuration lists rules of which tracker requests should be allowed for which websites. Care must be taken when writing these rules, since allowing tracker requests reduces privacy protection for users.

See:
- [Tracker Allowlist rule definitions](/features/tracker-allowlist.json)
  (Applies to all browser platforms.)
- [Platform-specific configuration override files](/overrides/)
- [The schema for tracker allowlist rules](/schema/features/tracker-allowlist.ts)

## Quick Cheat Sheet

### Tracker Allowlist Decision Tree (Strategy-Prioritized):


1. Search existing rules first for both the domain you're mitigating and the rule you have in mind (including platform overrides)
   - see [1. Choosing Trackers to Allow](#1-choosing-trackers-to-allow)
↓
2. Rule already exists? → Update domains/reason if needed. When updating, follow step 6 guidance.
↓
3. Rule doesn't exist? → Make sure your new rule is specific but stable
   - Example: "tracker.com/api/endpoint" (Avoid domain-only rules and dynamic params like user/session IDs, tokens, timestamps)
   - see [1.1. Not too generic nor too specific](#11-not-too-generic-nor-too-specific) 
↓
4. Check if the new rule shares prefix with existing rules
   - Example: "tracker.com/api/endpoint" shares prefix with "tracker.com/api", but not with "sub.tracker.com/api/endpoint"
   - see [2.2. Rule Specificity and Ordering](#22-rule-specificity-and-ordering-when-order-matters-vs-doesnt-matter)
↓
5. It shares prefix? → Order most-specific → least-specific
   - Example: "tracker.com/api/endpoint" comes before "tracker.com/api"
   - see [2.2. Rule Specificity and Ordering](#22-rule-specificity-and-ordering-when-order-matters-vs-doesnt-matter)
   - Should this apply to all domains? Use `<all>` if appropriate and see [2.4. The `<all>` Specifier](#24-the-all-specifier-essential-considerations)
↓
6. Add the site domain to all rules that share the same prefix
   - Example: If you add "site.com" to "tracker.com/api", also add it to any more-specific rule such as "tracker.com/api/endpoint"
   - see [2.3. Domain Propagation](#23-domain-propagation-when-duplicating-domain-is-required) 
   - Should this apply to all domains? Use `<all>` if appropriate (domain propagation not needed when using `<all>`) see [2.4. The `<all>` Specifier](#24-the-all-specifier-essential-considerations)
↓
7. Multi-country/sibling sites might be affected? → Consider cross-entity coverage
   - see [4. Cross-Entity Coverage](#4-cross-entity-coverage)
↓
8. Domain-wide exception needed? → Avoid if possible; document thoroughly if required
   - see [5. Domain-Wide Exceptions](#5-domain-wide-exceptions)


### Reference Tracker Rule Set

```json
"tracker.com": {
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule": "tracker.com/static/widget.js/config/analytics",  // Most specific first
      "domains": [
        "site1.com",
        "site3.com" // Add site3.com so domain propagation can work
      ],
      "reason": [
        "site1.com - https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/pull/1111",
        "site3.com - https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/pull/3333"
      ]
    },
    {
      "rule": "tracker.com/static/widget.js/config",  // Less specific, shares prefix, the original tracker intended to allow on site3.com
      "domains": [
        "site3.com"
      ],
      "reason": [
        "site3.com - https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/pull/3333"
      ]
    },
    {
      "rule": "tracker.com/static/widget.js",  // Least specific, shares prefix
      "domains": [
        "<all>" // no need to add specific domain, <all> covers all domains
      ],
      "reason": "https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/pull/4444"
    },
    {
      "rule": "tracker.com/api/collect",  // Different prefix, order doesn't matter
      "domains": [
        "site2.com"
      ],
      "reason": "site2.com - https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/pull/2222"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Site Mitigation Triager In-Depth Guideline

### 1. Choosing Trackers to Allow

### 1.1. Not too generic nor too specific
- Avoid domain-only rules (no path): `"rule": "tracker.com"`
- Avoid temporary URLs with dynamic parameters (eg. user or session IDs, tokens, timestamps)
- Use specific, stable endpoint paths: `"rule": "tracker.com/api/endpoint"`

### 1.2. Avoid regex/wildcards
This is because platforms have varying support for these.

✅ **Examples of Suitable Specific Paths:**
```json
{
  "tracker.com": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "rule": "tracker.com/api/scripts/main.js",  // Specific file
        "domains": ["site1.com"],
        "reason": [
          "site1.com - https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/issues/1111"
          ]
      },
      {
        "rule": "tracker.com/api/analytics",  // Specific API endpoint
        "domains": ["site2.com"],
        "reason": "site2.com - https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/pull/2222"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Rule Precedence (Ordering)

**Critical:** Order rules **most‑specific → least‑specific,** but **only** when both can match the same tracker request. Rules must share a prefix: `foo.com/bar` is a prefix of `foo.com/bar/baz`.

### 2.1. How the Matching Algorithm Works: First Match Wins Principle

The algorithm follows a "first match wins" principle: it checks rules from top to bottom and stops at the first matching rule.

1. **Check rules from top to bottom** until a rule matches the request URL.
2. **When a rule matches:**
   - If the current site domain is in the rule's `domains` list → allowlist applies (request is **not blocked**)
   - If the rule's `domains` list contains `<all>` → allowlist applies (request is **not blocked**)
   - Otherwise → allowlist does not apply (request is **blocked**)
3. **The algorithm stops** at the first match and uses that rule's domain list (subsequent rules are ignored).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tracker.com": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "rule": "tracker.com/api/analytics", // Most specific first
        "domains": ["site1.com"],
        "reason": ["site1.com - https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/issues/1111"]
      },
      {
        "rule": "tracker.com/api", // Less specific second
        "domains": ["<all>"],
        "reason": "https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/pull/2222"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `tracker.com/api/analytics` on `site1.com`: Matches first rule → `site1.com` in list → **allowed**
- `tracker.com/api/other` on any site: Doesn't match first rule, matches second rule → `<all>` applies → **allowed** 


### 3. Rule Precedence (Ordering)

3.1. **Critical:** Order rules **most‑specific → least‑specific,** but **only** when both can match the same request. Same-host prefix matching is required: foo.com/bar is a prefix of foo.com/bar/baz.

Ordering does not matter for different hosts (they never match). For example, www.example.com/foo ≠ example.com/foo ≠ cdn.example.com/foo.

**Example - Correct Ordering:**


```json
{
  "example.com": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "rule": "example.com/foo/bar/baz",  // ✅ Most specific first
        "domains": ["site1.com"],
        "reason": "https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/issues/123"
      },
      {
        "rule": "example.com/foo/bar",  // ✅ Less specific second
        "domains": ["site2.com"],
        "reason": "https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/issues/456"
      },
      {
        "rule": "example.com",  // ✅ Least specific last
        "domains": ["site3.com"],
        "reason": "https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration/issues/789"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3.2. **Adding domains to less-specific rules:**

Add the domain to both the more-specific and less-specific rules.
**Why?** The first matching rule is checked. If a request matches a more-specific rule but the domain isn't in that rule's list, it blocks.

```json
{
  "rule": "example.com/foo/bar/baz",  // More specific
  "domains": ["site1.com", "site2.com"]  // ✅ Add site2.com here too
},
{
  "rule": "example.com/foo/bar",  // Less specific
  "domains": ["site2.com"]  // ✅ Added here
}
```

### 4. Cross-Entity Coverage

- **Multi-country brands:** Consider adding mitigations across country sites (e.g., `vinted.com`, `vinted.fr`, `vinted.de`)

- **Sibling sites under same parent company:** Check if breakage exists, then consider adding coverage across a business group

### 5. Domain-Wide Exceptions

**Avoid whenever possible.** If you must add one, make sure your PR clearly explains the reason, including whether this is part of a speculative mitigation experiment
